# Schema PHP

A library to generate schema.org JSON-LD.

This library is designed to be used in PHP applications to generate schema.org compliant JSON-LD data for
embedding in web pages. It provides a simple and flexible way to create structured data that can help improve
SEO and enhance search engine results. However, this library is by no means an exhaustive implmentation of the
schema.org specification, nor does it aspire to be. It is a collection of the items that have been necessary for
client projects. As such, it grows as new requirements are encountered.
